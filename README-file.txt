## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-This project reintroduced me to different CSS grid and flexbox properties and how to apply them. 
-I learnt how to set up an HTML project remotely
-I now have some knowledge about github repositories and file hosting.


### Continued development

I have to keep working on the following:
-Active and Hover state of elements.
-HTML workflow and semantics.
-Media query and other responsive CSS properties.
-Using Github.


### Useful resources

- [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) : This organization and her community scaled me through HTML/CSS upon which I used for this project. I recommend Freecodecamp to anyone interested in learning web development.
- [Google](https://www.google.com) : This is an amazing tool to use when one is stucked. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning. Google helped in a lot of way through W3 school, MDN, etc.
